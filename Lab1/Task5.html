                <h3>EcoPulse</h3>
                <p>Designed and implemented an IoT-based system to monitor CO₂ levels in real-time with 98% sensor accuracy using 
                    Raspberry Pi and MQ-135 sensors. 
                    Developed a full-stack web application with a live dashboard to visualize CO₂ trends and 7-day trends to generate threshold
                    based alerts. 
                    Integrated MySQL database for logging 10,000+ sensor data entries, enabling actionable historical insights. 
                    Enabled automated CO2 level alerts above 425ppm, promoting timely corrective actions for reducing carbon footprint. </p>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Online Course Recommendation Bot</h3>
                <p>Built an AI chatbot using Flask and IBM watsonx.ai that delivered 95% accurate course suggestions based on user interests.  
                    Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a curated dataset of 50+ tech courses to provide context-aware, 
                    domain-specific course recommendations.  
                    Developed a chatbot frontend in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serving 50+ test users via a REST API-connected backend 
                    hosted on cloud.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-item">
                <h3>Legal Document Classification Tool</h3>
                <p>Engineered an AI-driven tool that achieved 92% classification accuracy on legal texts across 3+ categories (contracts, 
                    petitions, judgments). 
                    Utilized IBM watsonx.ai foundation models with prompt engineering to handle 200+ unstructured legal documents with 
                    minimal training data. 
                    Reduced classification ambiguity by 30% through iterative prompt refinement and user testing.    </p>
